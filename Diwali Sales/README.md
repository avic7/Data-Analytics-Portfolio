# Diwali Sales Data Cleaning & Standardization

## Dataset Details  
The Diwali Sales dataset was originally shared on Kaggle by **Saad Haroon**.  
It contains transactional sales data from a retail store during the Diwali festival period in India. The dataset includes customer demographics, product information, purchase amounts, and order details.  

## Project Overview  
My main task was to **clean and standardize** the raw Diwali sales data in **PostgreSQL** to prepare it for further analysis. The goal was to make the dataset structured, consistent, and analysis-ready.  

The main cleaning steps included:  
- Renaming columns into **sensible, snake_case names**  
- Dropping unnecessary attributes (IDs, redundant columns)  
- Handling **NULL values** by either filling or removing as appropriate  
- Standardizing categorical values (e.g., consistent formatting for `gender`, `marital_status`, `state`, `occupation`)  
- Converting values into **correct data types** (`int`, `float`, `text`)  
- Normalizing fields such as `age_group` and `zone` for consistency  

The final cleaned dataset has:  
- **16 attributes**  
- **3,755 unique users**  
- **6,584 unique purchase amounts**

## SQL Skills Used  
- Table Creation & Alteration (`CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`)  
- Data Manipulation (`UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT INTO`)  
- Data Type Conversion (`CAST`, `ALTER COLUMN TYPE`)  
- Handling Missing Values (`COALESCE`, `NULLIF`)  
- Normalization (e.g., standardizing category text)

## Errors & Issues Encountered  
While cleaning the dataset, I ran into:  
- **Inconsistent categorical values**: Some states and occupations had typos/extra spaces, requiring trimming and standardization.  
- **Age group mismatch**: Age and `age_group` columns sometimes conflicted, so groups were normalized.  
- **Numeric stored as text**: `amount` and `orders` were stored as strings and needed conversion.  
- **Mixed casing in categorical values**: e.g., `Male` vs `M`, `Female` vs `F`. Resolved by enforcing consistent text.
